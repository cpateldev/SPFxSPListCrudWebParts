# SPFx Web object initialization options

The goal here is how can we initialize Web object for another site collection from current site. This is common sitation where a webpart of extension wants to perform CRUD operations on Lists that belongs to different sites.

e.g if corrent context site is "Web1" below are two approaches that shows how can we initialize Web object for site "Web2" and query any list in Web2 site collection.

REF: Call another web's list item using PnPjs: https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/sp/webs/#access-a-web

---

### Option 1: Using `.using(SPFx(this.context))`

```typescript
// Approach 1: requires - import { SPFI, SPFx } from "@pnp/sp";
/*
    Call another web's list item using PnPjs
    https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/sp/webs/#access-a-web

    The below examples show you how to use the constructor to create the base url for the Web although none of them are usable as is until you add observers. 
    You can do so by either adding them explicitly with a using...

    import { SPFi, SPFx } from "@pnp/sp";
    import { Web } from "@pnp/sp/webs";

    const web1 = Web("https://tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/myweb").using(SPFx(this.context));

    without line ".using(SPFx(this.context))" you will get the error 'Error: No observers registered for this request. (https://pnp.github.io/pnpjs/queryable/queryable#no-observers-registered-for-this-request)'
*/

const _web = Web(weburl).using(SPFx(this.context));
```

### Breakdown:

1. **`Web(weburl)`**:
   - This creates a new instance of a `Web` object from the PnPjs library (`@pnp/sp/webs`).
   - `weburl` is a string variable that specifies the URL of the SharePoint site you want to interact with (e.g., `"https://m365devlab01.sharepoint.com/sites/Web2"`).
   - The `Web` object allows you to perform operations on the specified SharePoint site, such as retrieving lists, items, or other resources.

2. **`.using(SPFx(this.context))`**:
   - The `.using()` method is used to attach an "observer" to the `Web` object. Observers in PnPjs are middleware-like components that handle things like authentication or request configuration.
   - `SPFx(this.context)` is a specific observer provided by PnPjs for SharePoint Framework (SPFx) projects. It ensures that the `Web` object is properly configured to work within the SPFx context.
     - `this.context` is the SPFx web part context, which provides information about the current SharePoint environment (e.g., the current site, user, and authentication details).
   - Without this observer, you would encounter the error: **"No observers registered for this request"**, as PnPjs wouldn't know how to authenticate or send requests.

3. **Purpose**:
   - This line initializes a `Web` object for the SharePoint site specified by `weburl` and configures it to use the SPFx context for authentication and request handling.

### Why This is Important:
- In SPFx projects, you must use the `SPFx` observer to ensure that PnPjs can properly authenticate and interact with SharePoint. Without it, your requests to SharePoint would fail.

### Example Use Case:
After this line, you can use `_web` to perform operations like retrieving a list or its items:
```typescript
const listItems = await _web.lists.getByTitle("MyList").items();
console.log(listItems);
```

### Summary:
This line creates a `Web` object for the specified SharePoint site (`weburl`) and configures it to use the SPFx context for authentication and request handling. It is essential for making authenticated requests in SPFx projects using PnPjs.

### Option 2: Using `Web([_sp.web, weburl])`

```typescript
// Approach 2: recommended. No need to import SPFI
const _web = Web([_sp.web, weburl]); 
```

### Breakdown:
1. **`Web`**:
   - This is a function or class from the PnPjs library (`@pnp/sp`) that is used to interact with a specific SharePoint site. It allows you to perform operations like retrieving lists, items, and other SharePoint resources.

2. **`[_sp.web, weburl]`**:
   - This is an array containing two elements:
     - `_sp.web`: This is likely a reference to the current SharePoint web context (e.g., the site where the web part is running). It is initialized elsewhere in your project, probably using PnPjs's SPFx integration.
     - `weburl`: This is a string variable defined earlier in the code (`"https://m365devlab01.sharepoint.com/sites/Web2"`) that specifies the URL of the SharePoint site you want to interact with.

3. **Purpose of the Array**:
   - By passing an array (`[_sp.web, weburl]`) to the `Web` function, you are essentially telling PnPjs to use the current SharePoint context (`_sp.web`) but override its base URL with the `weburl`. This approach allows you to work with a different SharePoint site (`weburl`) while still leveraging the existing context.

4. **Why This Approach is Recommended**:
   - This method avoids the need to explicitly import and configure the `SPFI` object (SharePoint Fluent Interface) using `.using(SPFx(this.context))`. It simplifies the setup and reduces boilerplate code while still allowing you to interact with a specific SharePoint site.

### Summary:
This line creates a `Web` object that points to the SharePoint site specified by `weburl`, while leveraging the existing `_sp.web` context. It is a concise and recommended way to work with multiple SharePoint sites in PnPjs without additional configuration.

### Comparison:

| Feature                          | Option 1 (`.using(SPFx(this.context))`) | Option 2 (`Web([_sp.web, weburl])`) |
|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Explicit SPFx Configuration** | Required                                | Not Required                        |
| **Ease of Use**                  | Slightly verbose                        | More concise                        |
| **Flexibility**                  | Works for any SPFx context              | Leverages existing `_sp.web`        |
| **Recommended**                  | No                                      | Yes                                 |

Both approaches achieve the same goal of creating a `Web` object for interacting with a SharePoint site, but Option 2 is generally preferred for its simplicity and efficiency.
